a list of posting entries for inverted index:
abcd XXXXXX
Every token consists only of [a-z0-9]
the token is separated by a single space
the first 4bytes following it is the size of the documentlist in bytes following it.
The remaining is variable byte encoded. with an even number of values. the first set is the differences in doc_ids starting with 0

Postings are concatanated.
At the end of the postings The dictionary begins.
abcd offset
the token is followed by a single space. and then is a 8byte 64-bit integer specifying offset in file where the coorresponding posting begins.
